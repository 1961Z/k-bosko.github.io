### VERIFYING SITE OWNERSHIP AND ADDING GOOGLE ANALYTICS



<i class="far fa-sticky-note"></i> **Note:** It can take some time after verifying your site to start seeing data in Search Console reports, so be patient. The same is true for Google Analytics.

### ENABLING PUBLIC COMMENTS

Minimal Mistakes supports a lot of comment providers, which for a newbie like me is quite overwhelming. 
I tried to enable Staticman, because it allows to escape reliance on third-party services. But as of now it seems to have problems with API calls to GitHub and the solution to host own instance of Staticman API didn't appeal to me. [^f1]

So I decided to go with [Disqus](https://disqus.com). However, you need to signup with them and provide your website's shortname. Enable `disqus` as provider and add the shortname to your `_config.yml`.

[^f1]: Some people host Staticman with Heroku. If you are interested, check out this [tutorial](https://www.datascienceblog.net/post/other/staticman_comments/). Not sure if it works though. 


--------------------------------------------

### ADDING FAVICON

Favicon
: is a small icon associated with your website. Like this one:
![favicon](../favicon.ico)

Minimal Mistakes has the ability to add these small icons to different browsers. You have first to generate them with [https://realfavicongenerator.net/](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) and then put the final images to your root directory and the links generated by the favicon generator to `_includes/head/custom.html`


-------------------------------------------------
### ENACTING TWITTER CARDS AND FACEBOOK OPEN GRAPH

[Twitter Cards](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/optimize-with-cards/overview/abouts-cards.html) and [Facebook OG](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/sharing/webmasters) are also built into the theme. You have all necessary meta tags in `_includes/seo.html`. To access them, the [Twitter Button](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/tweet-button/overview.html) needs to have url set properly. 

<i class="far fa-sticky-note"></i> **Note:** Make sure that your url in `_config.yml` starts with `https://www`. Otherwise your metatags for Twitter and Facebook won’t work because they won’t recognize it as url.

Both Twitter Cards and Facebook OG rely on either image from `og_image` that you can specify in `_config.yml` or on particular teaser image that you specify on page's Front Matter. Don't forget to add `excerpt` to Front Matter for short description of post's content to be shared via Twitter and FB.
