**TLDR: Don't make a stupid mistake of commiting your auto-generated sitemap.xml to GitHub.**


## Context
I host my Minimal Mistakes Jekyll site on GitHub and commit all the changes there. 
sitemap.xml is autogenerated with [jekyll-sitemap plugin](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-sitemap/blob/master/Gemfile) 

## Problem
Unindexed pages as shown in Google Search Console

Index Coverage report in Google Search Console gave me 1 error message and 12 pages that were indexed, but not submitted in sitemap:

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/posts/Sitemap-XML-Google-Search-Console-1000.png" alt="Index Coverage Report in Google Search Console" caption="Index Coverage Report in Google Search Console"%}


## Solution
Delete sitemap.xml from GitHub

Building site locally showed no sitemap problems, so jekyll-plugin worked as intended. 
The problem was that I committed the sitemap.xml to GitHub Pages where I host my site. When generating the site, GitHub also generates the new sitemap.xml via jekyll-plugin. But because such file already existed (the old version that was committed earlier), it simply ignored the new version.

The mistake is really stupid. Hope you learned from this post not to make it.
