excerpt: "Review of Udacity Data Science Nanodegree"
---

I am a big fan of lifelong learning and happy to live in the MOOCs age. Recently I graduated from my second Nanodegree on Udacity. [^ft1] 

Still more to go, but the goal of becoming a full-time data scientist is within reach now!

## Prerequisites

When starting the program in February, I was a bit scared taking the full leap into Python/Git without having any prior knowledge.[^ft2] The correct way would have been probably to start with either [Data Analyst](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002) or [Programming for Data Science with Python](https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-for-data-science-nanodegree--nd104) programs and build up the Python skills first. Luckily for me, Udacity provided the necessary material in Extracurricular. And what's good - you don't have to meet the deadlines for each project, you just need to complete all the projects by the program deadline which is final. This flexibility allowed me to skyrocket my programming skills and basically do two programs during the first term. It was intense, but managable. _Audacious_ approved![^ft3] ðŸ˜‰ 

## Structure

The UDSND I completed had 2 terms (3 months + 4 months), so you really need to commit to studying during long period of time in order to graduate. Typical to Udacity, it has been now restructured into two - the first term is now a separate Nanodegree ["Intro to Machine Learning"](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning-nanodegree--nd229), while the new [Data Science Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025) is identical with the second term of my program. 


## Content
So what have I learned? 

The first term covered **supervised machine learning (ML), unsupervised ML and deep learning**. The second term was focused more on developing proper DS practices with basic introduction into software engineering and data engineering for data scientists:
-  how to do the full data science cycle and **communicate the results** to various stakeholders (general/technical audiences)
-  how to **write clean code**, create unit tests and build classes
-  how to **run ML pipelines**, transform data, build models and **deploy solutions** to the cloud as an app
-  how to design experiments and analyze **A/B test** results 

I really enjoyed working on 7 real-world industry projects (including capstone) that covered all major topics in data science. Submitting the projects as GitHub repositories (with proper READMEs) really helps become experienced **Git and command line user.** 

## Projects' Reviews
Like most of the MOOCs, the projects are reviewed by the Udacity community itself, which keeps growing and thus becomes self-serving. On the plus side of this model, you can count on very quick review which facilitates fast learning loop. On the minus side, however, is the quality of reviews. Sometimes you get really good personalized feedback which points to some real problems in your code, sometimes you get a very generic feedback that would suit any student with some subjective instructions what to change. 

But I believe that is common for any online education platform. Ultimately, it's up to you to ensure the quality of your learning. If you 
take it seriously and don't cheat, Udacity Nanodegrees are great stepping stones for further in-depth study.

## Summing up:
- it's ok to enroll into more advanced Nanodegree without prior knowledge. Udacity provides material in Extracurricular. 
- it's ok to miss deadlines for projects as long as you complete all of them by the program's deadline which is final.
- you learn project-wise and graduate with a great [portfolio](/portfolio) to start with.








[^ft1]: The first one is ["Predictive Analytics for Business"](https://www.udacity.com/course/predictive-analytics-for-business-nanodegree--nd008) which teaches the same analytical techniques (Classification Models, A/B Testing, Segmentation and Clustering, etc.) but using Alteryx instead of Python.
[^ft2]: I learned some R in 2013/2014 for my academic projects, but haven't applied it for like five years now. Beyond that, I did't really have much experience in programming. 
[^ft3]: The company's name "Udacity" is a word play of 'audacious' - willingness to take bold risks.
