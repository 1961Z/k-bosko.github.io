I am an aspiring Data Scientist, currently looking for job opportunities in SF Bay area. `Cross-validated` is my personal blog to keep track of my projects and different HOWTOs related to data science and tech.

I was born and grew up in Ukraine, and lived in Germany for almost 10 years, where I received my MA and PhD. Since 2018 I live in California, the US.

Having completed a [PhD](https://elib.suub.uni-bremen.de/edocs/00106196-1.pdf) in political science, I have experience in defining and executing methodological ambiguity that Data Science projects are abound. Unlike many other PhDs, I am accustomed to working at a fast pace environment as I worked as a lead editor of online analytical [journal](http://www.laender-analysen.de/ukraine/archiv.php) with two weeks publication schedule for more almost 5 years. As a result, I conceptualized more than 60 issues and worked with over a hundred academics worldwide. I also learned how to communicate results to different audiences as I have published over [30 analytical articles](http://bremen.academia.edu/KaterinaMalygina) and gave over 25 pubic talks.

I have been working with data for most of my professional life and understand the numerous pain points associated with data. I actually enjoy data wrangling which is believed to consume up to 80% of data scientistâ€™s job. During my PhD life, I have scraped several datasets (e.g. on elections and on political turnover) that I used to analyze in my publications. As a lead editor I was also responsible for data visualizations that accompanied the issues. So, I know how to tell stories with data and how to make them look nice.

I have exposure to many different data science algorithms and technologies. Having a broad background allows me to learn quickly and I like to learn. Through online learning, I acquired experience in A/B testing to recommend a menu launch, segmentation and clustering techniques to predict the best store format for a grocery chain, time series forecasting to predict the sale trends. I built classification models to predict loan default risks and ran linear regression models to recommend the catalogue launch. I also extracted enterprise information from the Teradata data warehouse, wrote complex MySQL queries and created several Tableau dashboards. Checkout my [portfolio](/portfolio) for other projects in deep learning, supervised and unsupervised ML.

I [read](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59162734-katerina-bosko) a lot of non-fiction on a wide range of topics, like traveling, hiking and jogging.
